    "description" : "I took the drone up to Blue Springs State Park to capture some shots of the springs. Unfortunately, I did not get to fly for too long as I was quickly approached by a park ranger who instructed me that it was prohibited to fly drones in Blue Springs. Luckily, I had gotten a few good shots and a few minutes of decent video footage. I left Blue Springs, and on the way back home I passed a beautiful marina by Lake Monroe, which is located passed Lake Mary on I4 East. I stopped there and took the drone out for a flight over the marina.",

I didn't realize how beautiful the surroundings to his house were until I was up in the air. The chain of lakes that surround his house are called the Butler chain. Unfortunately, I did not get a whole lot of good footage, so I wasn't able to create a video for it yet. But with another visit to his house, I should be able to produce something.",

    "description" : "Decided to take the drone out in Lido Key, Sarasota, yet again. This time I took off from the eastern end of the state park, so the scenery is a little differnt from the last previous Lido Key video. It was extremely windy when I took off. In fact, it was the strongest wind I've ever taken off in (definitely > 30 Mph); taking off was not an issue, but landning took some time and patience. After a few failed landing attempts, my girlfriend successfully managed to reach and grab the drifting drone out of the sky.",
